# astronomicalonline.com
Welcome! This dynamic website displays the latest images from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API in a clean style. 
# Motivation
I had two primary goals in building this website. My first goal was to build a website in which I could easily read a little bit about astronomy in the morning after the site updates itself. My second motivation was to build a project using MongoDB in order to become better acquainted with its features.
# Getting Started

# Technologies
My website uses Python's Flask framework along with MongoDB in order to dynamically update the website daily with the newest image from NASA's API. The site is updated using a Python script, which is run from my home server.
